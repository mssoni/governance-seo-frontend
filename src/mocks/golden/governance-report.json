Right now, search engines have less confidence ranking your pages, which means fewer people find you. Additionally, some visitors may struggle with slow loading or usability issues, which can drive them away. On the positive side, your site is encrypted and secure for visitors, your site works well on phones and tablets and you're tracking how visitors interact with your site. These are solid foundations to build on. We found 3 areas for improvement that could strengthen your position with visitors. The gaps we found are common and fixable \u2014 none require rebuilding your site.",
